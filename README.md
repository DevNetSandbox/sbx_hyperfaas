# sbx_hyperfaas - Cisco HyperFaaS Sandbox

Function as a service (FaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing developers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities (aka functions/microworkloads) without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure, typically associated with developing and launching a traditional app. Building an application following this model is one way of achieving a serverless architecture.

Cisco HyperFaaS is essentially a software add-on to the Kubernetes platforms, such as Cisco Container Platform, that enables function-style serverless computing for the enterprise data centers and Service Providers (SP) edge use cases.

Apart from plain functions deployment, Cisco HyperFaaS also allows triggering function execution with external application ecosystem events, such as Message Queuing (Kafka and MQTT), Database (MongoDB), Timer, Object storage (Minio), and others.

This Sandbox provides serverless application development and deployment instructions. Cisco HyperFaaS (an early-stage engineering prototype) platform, is used in this Sandbox to develop, deploy, and test the sample serverless applications. You are invited to create, deploy, and execute Cisco HyperFaaS native serverless workloads, such as functions, functions workflows, execution environments, and others.

## Objectives

This Sandbox tends to help you:

- Understand basic concepts of FaaS
- Familiarize yourself with Cisco HyperFaaS
- Get theoretical and practical introduction to Cisco DevNet Sandbox
- Learn to work with execution environments
- Understand a common flow of creating and executing functions and workflows
- Learn to work with function triggers

## Why it is needed

Serverless adoption is a growing trend and Cisco HyperFaaS is the easiest way to extend your existing resources and achieve function-style serverless computing on enterprise data centres or SP edge.

It saves stakeholdersâ€™ costs by reducing CapEx and OpEx and providing resources on demand with pay-per-use model. It also allows developers to focus on delivering valuable features without direct interaction with infrastructure components (e.g. containers, VMs or bare-metal servers).
